## First time setup
### Committee Members
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/icssc/peterportal-client
    ```

2. Check your Node version with `node -v`. Make sure you have version 18 or 20 LTS. If you don't, we recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node versions (or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)).

3. `cd` into the cloned repo.

4. Run `npm install` to install all node dependencies for the site and API. This may take a few minutes.

5. Setup the appropriate environment variables provided by the project lead.

6. Switch to a branch you will be working on for your current task (pick a name that's relevant to the issue).
    ```
    git checkout -b [branch name]
    ```

### Open Source Contributors
1. Fork the project by clicking the fork button in the top right, above the about section.

2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/peterportal-client
```

3. Check your Node version with `node -v`. Make sure you have version 18 or 20 LTS. If you don't, we recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node versions (or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)).

4. `cd` into the cloned repo.

5. Run `npm install` to install all node dependencies for the site and API. This may take a few minutes.

6. Create a .env file in the api directory with the following contents:
```
PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.peterportal.org/rest/v0/
PUBLIC_API_GRAPHQL_URL=https://api.peterportal.org/graphql/
PORT=8080
```
Note: the port should also match the one set up on the frontend's proxy to the backend under `site/vite.config.ts` By default this is 8080.

7. (Optional) Set up your own MongoDB and Google OAuth to be able to test features that require signing in such as leaving reviews or saving roadmaps to your account. Add additional variables/secrets to the .env file from the previous step.
```
MONGO_URL=<secret>
SESSION_SECRET=<secret>
GOOGLE_CLIENT=<client>
GOOGLE_SECRET=<secret>
GRECAPTCHA_SECRET=<secret>
ADMIN_EMAILS=["<your email>"]
```

## Open Source Contribution Guide
