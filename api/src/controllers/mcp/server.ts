/**
 * Builds the MCP server exposed to external AI agents and registers its tools.

 * Tools fall into three groups, all thin wrappers over existing tRPC procedures (via
 * {@link mcpCaller}): the authenticated student's own plan data (read), guarded plan writes,
 * and Anteater API course data. The tool definitions live in {@link ./tools}; every call is
 * authenticated (the student's user id comes from the verified bearer token) and counted
 * against the daily quota (see the `guard` wrapper in {@link ./tools/shared}).
